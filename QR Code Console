Here's the corresponding designer code that should be in your Form2.Designer.cs file:

```csharp
namespace WIP_Sticker
{
    partial class Form2
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Required designer variable.
        /// </summary>
        private System.ComponentModel.IContainer components = null;

        /// <summary>
        /// Clean up any resources being used.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="disposing">true if managed resources should be disposed; otherwise, false.</param>
        protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (disposing && (components != null))
            {
                components.Dispose();
            }
            base.Dispose(disposing);
        }

        #region Windows Form Designer generated code

        /// <summary>
        /// Required method for Designer support - do not modify
        /// the contents of this method with the code editor.
        /// </summary>
        private void InitializeComponent()
        {
            this.components = new System.ComponentModel.Container();
            this.AutoScaleDimensions = new System.Drawing.SizeF(8F, 16F);
            this.AutoScaleMode = System.Windows.Forms.AutoScaleMode.Font;
            this.ClientSize = new System.Drawing.Size(900, 600);
            this.Name = "Form2";
            this.Text = "WIP Details";
            this.ResumeLayout(false);
        }

        #endregion
    }
}
```

This is a minimal designer file that:
1. Contains the basic form setup
2. Includes the necessary dispose method for cleanup
3. Has the InitializeComponent method that sets basic form properties
4. Includes the required designer variable (components)

To use this:
1. Create a new Windows Form in your project
2. Replace the contents of Form2.Designer.cs with this code
3. Make sure your Form2.cs has the code from my previous response
4. Ensure both files are partial classes of Form2

The complete file structure should be:

1. Form2.cs (contains the main code I provided earlier)
2. Form2.Designer.cs (contains this designer code)
3. Form2.resx (will be automatically generated by Visual Studio)

The designer code is intentionally minimal because we're adding all our controls programmatically in the `SetupCustomControls` method. This approach gives you more control over the UI creation while still maintaining compatibility with the Windows Forms designer.

Remember to adjust the namespace (`WIP_Sticker`) to match your project's namespace if it's different.

Would you like me to explain any part of this designer code in more detail?
